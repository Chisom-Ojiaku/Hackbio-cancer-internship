Lung cancer affects about 2.2 million patients yearly, with 75% dead within five years due to drug resistance. Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on predicting outcomes and enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for lung cancer. This article explores ML roles and potential in lung cancer studies.


Early cancer detection reduces mortality leading to the development of enhanced Computer-Aided Diagnosis and ML models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs translate CT images and identify tumor regions. However, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) address the challenge of dataset overfitting encountered by CNNs.

 

The -omics sequencing datasets is a recent advancement in technology that has been employed for high-accuracy detection and overcome limitations of medical imaging datasets This study reported the integration of -omics datasets to be more precise in early detection and improve diagnosis of tumor signatures and subtype classification of lung cancers. Even with the high precision of -the omics sequencing dataset, feature selection is a significant challenge to avoid overfitting and model accuracy. Survival prediction has acquired greater prediction power with machine learning as compared to traditional physicians.

Since immunotherapy doesn't work for non-small cell lung cancer PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are used for treatment. Ai has been able to create a model that can analyze CT image data to predict immunotherapy responses. Deep learning methods such as CNNs and DeepTIL are used to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Machine Learning Algorithms such as NetMHC and NetMHCpan assist customized immunotherapies by predicting peptide-HLA binding for neoantigen prediction.                                                                                                                                           Vision Transformers and DL models are tools used to analyze complex imaging and omics datasets.

Machine learning tells us how to integrate various data types such as imaging, omics, and clinical records. These data types often face several challenges like platform noise, radionics data, and batch noise. We should address the batch effects and improve our model’s generalizability and robustness. Transfer learning and explainable AI tools are useful techniques to enhance our model’s experience. We need to select clinically important performance metrics such as accuracy, Area under curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity.  By integrating this multi-modal data into clinical decision-making tools, we can advance precision oncology, particularly in lung cancer treatments.

This article helps us understand different machine learning and Deeping learning models that help reduce lung cancer mortality rates in the world.
